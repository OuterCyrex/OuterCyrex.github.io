Hey, I am OuterCyrex (QQ:3286882719). I am a common backend developer and a newcomer,now studying Web backend development based on Golang.I expect to perfect my front and back end skills, and try my best to be a front and back end pro(maybe a joke).

Nowadays a undergraduate of SWPU(Southwest Petroleum University), and majoring in software engineering.Besides a member of Group Virtual Intelligence.

I also like Programming and Galgame very much, so this blog is the mixture of these two things.This blog is aiming to provide a place where I can record my learning track and some impressions about Galgame.
